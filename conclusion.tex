\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we described a new strong physical unclonable function (PUF) that is provably secure against machine learning (ML) attacks with both classical and quantum computers. 
The security is derived from cryptographic hardness of learning decryption functions of semantically secure public-key cryptosystems within the probably approximately correct  framework.
The proposed PUF realizes the decryption function of the learning-with-errors (LWE) public-key cryptosystem as the core block. 
We implemented a series of lattice PUF design, including a resource-efficient design and a latency-optimized design, on a Spartan 6 FPGA. The design realizes a challenge-response pair space of size $2^{136}$, requires $1280$ physically obfuscated key bits, and guarantees $128$-bit ML resistance. 
The PUF shows excellent uniformity, uniqueness, and reliability.
