\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a novel strong PUF with theoretically proven security against ML attacks conducted by both classical and quantum computers. Its security is guaranteed by the cryptographic hardness to learn decryption functions of public key cryptosystems. Our PUF is constructed from the LWE decryption function block. A series of designs are implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. A compact design uses a highly serialized LFSR and LWE decryption function, while a latency-optimized design uses an unrolled LFSR and a parallel datapath. The lattice PUF designs have a CRP space of $2^{136}$, with $6,360$ POK bits and $128$-bit concrete ML resistance. Excellent statistical characteristics are demonstrated.
