%\begin{abstract}
%Machine learning (ML) modeling attacks are a known threat to strong physical unclonable functions (PUFs). We construct a strong PUF with provable security against ML attacks conducted by both classical and quantum computers. Security is guaranteed by cryptographic hardness of learning decryption functions of public-key cryptosystems. Our construction is based on the hardness of the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem defined on integer lattices. Due to the fundamental connection of LWE to lattice problems, we call our construction the lattice PUF.

%We construct lattice PUF with a physically obfuscated key (POK), an LWE decryption function block, and a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR). The POK provides the secret key of the LWE decryption function, and the LFSR produces the full length challenge from a small challenge seed. A lightweight reverse fuzzy extractor (RFE) is adopted to ensure stability of POK bits. To allow deployments in many scenarios, we demonstrate designs with different latency-area trade-offs. A compact design uses a highly serialized LFSR and LWE decryption function, while a latency-optimized design uses an unrolled  LFSR and a parallel datapath.

%Our results show that the mean (std) of uniformity of the lattice PUF to be $49.98\%$ ($1.58\%$), of uniqueness to be $50.00\%$ ($1.58\%$), and of reliability to be $1.26\%$ ($2.88\%$). In addition to theoretical security guarantee, we evaluate empirical resistance to various leading ML techniques: the prediction error remains above $49.76\%$ after $1$ million training challenge-response pairs (CRPs). We prototyped lattice PUF designs with $2^{136}$ CRPs on a Spartan 6 FPGA. The resource-efficient design requires only $45$ slices for PUF logic proper, and $28$ slices for RFE. The latency-optimized design achieves a $148X$ reduction in latency, at a $10X$ increase in PUF hardware utilization.

The resource-efficient design requires only $45$ slices for PUF logic proper, and $27$ slices for RFE. The latency-optimized design achieves a $148X$ reduction in latency, at a $10X$ increase in PUF hardware utilization. The mean uniformity of PUF responses is $49.97\%$, the mean uniqueness is $50.00\%$, and the mean reliability is $1.26\%$.
